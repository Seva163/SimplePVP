A plugin that allows configuring PVP logic on the server.

## **Features**
- **No unnecessary**: The plugin is designed to be understandable for any player. It does not include burdensome features.
- **PVP Timer**: Sets a timer for PVP mode during which players cannot exit the game or use certain commands.
- **PVP by gamemodes**: Configure permissions to disable PVP in specific gamemodes.
- **Easy to configure**: The configuration does not contain excessive information and is easy to set up.

## **Permissions**
- Allows PVP in a specific game mode: `simplepvp.gamemode.<gamemode>`
- Disables the PVP timer, along with death upon exiting and blocking commands: `simplepvp.timer.bypass`
